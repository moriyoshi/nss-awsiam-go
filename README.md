# nss_awsiam_go

This is a glibc NSS (name server switch) module, which does the query against AWS IAM user and group registry.

## Building

```
$ make
```

will produce `libnss_awsiam_go.so` in the current working directory.  You can put it under `/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` (may vary by the configuration of your OS) as `libnss_awsiam_go.so.2` to get it to work.
